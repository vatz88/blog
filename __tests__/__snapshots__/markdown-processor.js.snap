<p>Posted on May 8, 2018</p>
<hr>
<p>I belong to the class of 2018, B.Tech. in Information Technology, <a href=\\"https://vit.ac.in\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">VIT</a>, Vellore campus. If you are reading this, you're probably a student of VIT and want to know about campus placements. I never had the exact idea about how the whole placement thing works, until it began for my batch. Knowing a few things before sitting for the placements would definitely help. This will be a good read for you if you're looking forward to take part in campus placements at VIT.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> All facts and figures are to best of my knowledge. Everything here is my personal opinion and so is, any advice you come across while reading. You should follow and figure out what works best for you.</p>
<p><strong>What I Have Covered In This Post:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>An overview Of Placements</li>
<li>How To Prepare</li>
<li>My Personal Experience</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=\\"an-overview-of-placements\\"><a href=\\"#an-overview-of-placements\\">An Overview Of Placements</a></h2>
<p>VIT broadly divides companies into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Dream: CTC more than 10L</li>
<li>Dream: CTC between 4L to 10L</li>
<li>Regular: CTC less than 4L</li>
</ul>
<p>That's how VIT looks at companies. I have a different view. I would rather categorize them based on the job profile they offer. There are mainly two, core developer job (mostly super dream offer) and the other one is some sort of analyst (mostly dream offer). There are also the mass placement companies (regular offer), but I'm not exactly sure what kind of work they offer to so many people (usually in the range of hundreds) they hire. More on these categories and how to prepare for them in the later section.</p>
<p>Companies start visiting the campus as early as during the 6th semester, although that's only couple of them, from what I remember, Cisco and RBS (Royal Bank of Scotland). Both belong to the super dream category. I wasn't eligible to apply to either of them because of my standing arrear in one subject. This brings us to very important thing about companies one must know, their eligibility criteria.</p>
<h3 id=\\"eligibility-criteria\\"><a href=\\"#eligibility-criteria\\">Eligibility Criteria</a></h3>
<p>There nothing much you can do if companies don't allow you to apply for the job. Most important of all is, NO STANDING ARREARS criteria. All companies have it and if you have a standing arrear, please clear it before starting of the 7th semester, or you could miss out the whole placement season. There will be companies coming in the 8th semester as well, but it would be very depressing to not be eligible for any of the companies (even the mass placement ones) in the 7th semester. After this comes the company specific criteria, CGPA. All most all of the banks have a criteria of minimum CGPA of 9. Then there are some companies in dream offer category which have CGPA criteria of 8.5. The good part is most super dream companies offering core software developer job (for example Amazon, PayPal, Directi) don't have such high CGPA cutoffs. If you're a 9 pointer, awesome, you'll be able to apply to all companies. Otherwise, I would suggest you to try and have a CGPA of 8.5 which will make you eligible for most of the companies. And if not 8.5, nothing to worry, my CGPA never touched 8.5! Yes, I was not eligible to apply to many of the companies.</p>
<h2 id=\\"how-to-prepare\\"><a href=\\"#how-to-prepare\\">How To Prepare</a></h2>
<p>The process of selection all the companies follow is something like this - screening and then 2 to 4 rounds of interview. It may vary depending upon the company. Considering the number of students studying in VIT and the fact that VIT holds common placements for both Vellore and Chennai campus students, the real challenge I believe is the initial screening round. You're more likely to get placed if you get shortlisted a few times for the interviews, and that'll only happen if you get through the screening round.</p>
<p>Core developer job has competitive coding on some online platform as screening round. While other jobs too, have a online test, but the focus is less on coding skills and includes questions on aptitude and other soft skills.</p>
<h3 id=\\"preparing-for-core-developer-job-profile\\"><a href=\\"#preparing-for-core-developer-job-profile\\">Preparing For Core Developer Job Profile</a></h3>
<p>If you enjoy coding then this is the job profile you should focus on. Solving coding challenges on platforms like <a href=\\"https://www.hackerearth.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">HackerEarth</a> and <a href=\\"https://www.hackerrank.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">HackerRank</a> on regular basis should be more than enough. I must emphasize here that <strong>dynamic programming</strong> questions are more likely to be asked and you must be prepared for it. That's all for the screening round. For the interview, prepare Data Structures and Algorithms well. You must know most common data structures like queues, linked lists, binary trees and graphs. You should be able to code it's implementation and also know implementing algorithms relating to the data structure, for example, finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. Sorting algorithms are important as well. Some basic theoretical understanding of complexity of algorithm and Big O notations will be helpful too. If you can, practice writing code on paper for interviews. You can check out <a href=\\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">GeeksforGeeks</a> for getting an idea about the interview questions.</p>
<h3 id=\\"preparing-for-non-developer-job-profile\\"><a href=\\"#preparing-for-non-developer-job-profile\\">Preparing For Non Developer Job Profile</a></h3>
<p>Don't try too hard on getting a developer job if you don't enjoy coding, otherwise you're mostly going to get rejected during the interview (they'll sense it!) or may not be a good fit in the work environment and eventually hate your job. Caution that I say, if you don't enjoy coding, if you like coding and feel you're not up to the mark, you can always improvise. With that being said, for non developer jobs, focus more on soft skills. Aptitude questions will be important for screening round.</p>
<h2 id=\\"my-personal-experience\\"><a href=\\"#my-personal-experience\\">My Personal Experience</a></h2>
<p>I got placed in <a href=\\"https://www.tapzo.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">Tapzo</a> / <a href=\\"https://www.onedirect.in\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">OneDirect</a> (both are owned by the same parent company, Coraza Technologies), a startup in Banglore. It's a super dream offer and developer job profile (exactly what I wanted!). Luckily, I got placed in 1st week of August itself, that's 2 weeks from when placements began in 7th semester. Fall semester during my time started in mid July. Before that, I was rejected in interview with Amazon and McKinsey. There were other companies like D. E. Shaw and Morgan Stanley who would not let apply because of my low CGPA. Didn't clear the screening rounds of PayPal and Directi. This is when I got to know the importance of dynamic programming.</p>
<p>Coming to interviews I attended:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Amazon - somewhere around 3000 students applied, screening round was online coding. Some 30 students were selected for the interview round. I didn't go through the first interview round, where I was asked two binary tree questions. This is when I got to know the importance of being able to write good code on paper. Until then and well still, it has not been my approach to writing code. I write code and run it, it'll probably fail a few test cases and then I correct it and keep repeating until I get it right. I don't think it's very important to write neat, perfect code in first attempt. Although, I appreciate people who can do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>McKinsey - screening round was similar to Amazon, but coding questions were comparatively easier than that were asked in screening round of Amazon. There were two screening rounds, both similar, online coding test. There were three coding questions in the first round, I solved all of them except didn't get 3 test cases for the last one (thanks to JavaScript, which was enabled for coding, unlike Amazon which restricted coding only in C, C++, Java and Python). In the second screening round (they called it code pairing, but it was nothing like code pairing!) there was only one coding question. I did solve it but due a stupid silly mistake the test cases didn't pass. There was only one sample test case which didn't cover a very important scenario and I didn't think of it either, and as seeing the input of the test cases is not possible, I was not able to figure it out the whole time why the test cases are failing. I still made it to the interview round, maybe because it was the average of the scores in both the rounds, considering I had good score in the first round (I'm not sure though, if that was the reason I made it to the interview round). The interview was complete opposite of what I experienced in Amazon. They focused on technologies I'm interested and my projects. Even though, I did have good, real projects in my resume, I was not selected for the last HR round. Perhaps, I did not have good start to the interview. I was asked, if I have a good sense of humor, to which I replied yes (I don't know why!!!). It didn't stop there, they asked me if can tell them a joke. I said no, I can't think of any right now, but they still insisted on me telling a joke. After a silence of few seconds, I did say something, they didn't laugh, of course it was not funny and I knew it. Maybe, this is what happens when you have all the data structures and algorithms going in your head and you are asked something this stupid. Rest of the interview, I did well but may have answered a few technical questions wrong. One question I remember is they asked me about promises in javascript and even though javascript was my favorite language, I didn't know back then, what promises were. I confused it with the npm package passport 🤦‍♂️.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets come to Tapzo / OneDirect where I finally got placed. The screening process was a bit different. Everyone was asked to fill a google form which asked for the details like links to projects and online profiles like GitHub, HackerEarth / HackerRank and Stack Overflow. I had all of it and so getting shortlisted was easy. Some 600+ people filled the google form out of which 81 were shortlisted for the second round. It included solving three coding questions on paper. Difficulty level was moderate and yes this time I wrote much neater code than what I had done with Amazon. Somewhere around 20 were shortlisted for the interview. Interview went well. It had technical questions, some general talk and one simple coding question. Compared to all other interviews, this one was chill. Interviewer made me feel really comfortable. It didn't feel like very formal, we were just chatting in Hindi 😄. Also, I was not asked something stupid, off the topic questions. I like not to be judged for unnecessary stuff. At the end there was a cultural fit check, just to see If I'll fit the companies culture. Few minutes later, the HR came into the room and told me I'm selected and explained me the package. F*cking ₹xxxxxxx CTC! You kidding me!!! It was an amazing feeling. Never before I felt I was worth that CTC.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Hope this post was worth your time. All the best if you're to sit for the placements.</p>",

<p>If you are new to Linux probably switching from Windows, getting Linux up and running on your system can be tiresome.
Here, I have tried to list down the problems I faced while setting up my system along with their solutions. Also, I have added some extra things you might want to do as a developer.
In the end I have added some useful Linux commands which will be helpful to you if you are a first time Linux user.
I will be more specific towards the issues which may arise while installing and skip the common steps which you can find from a google search. I have Asus ROG GL552VW which comes with Nvidia graphics card and Windows installed.</p>
<h2 id=\\"installing-ubuntu\\"><a href=\\"#installing-ubuntu\\">Installing Ubuntu</a></h2>

<h1 id=\\"components-with-async-friendly-event-handlers\\"><a href=\\"#components-with-async-friendly-event-handlers\\">Components With Async Friendly Event Handlers</a></h1>
<p>Posted on May 26, 2021</p>
<hr>
<p>All apps have to listen to user input, it could be a button click or some text being typed in an input box. These user actions in return perform a task like api call, validating the input, etc. These actions can be asynchronous in nature and it's in these cases where having async event handlers is quite beneficial.</p>
<p>Let's take a simple example of a button. On clicking the button, we'll make an api call and then render an image from the api's response. I'll be using React here but these ideas remain same for other frameworks too.</p>
<!-- Sync onClick handler -->
<iframe src=\\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/sync-onclick-handler-tqw54?autoresize=1&#x26;fontsize=14&#x26;hidenavigation=1&#x26;module=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js&#x26;theme=dark\\" style=\\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\\" title=\\"Sync onClick handler\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\\" sandbox=\\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\\"></iframe>
<p>As you can try in the above example it works perfectly well. But what if it's an expensive api call (time consuming) or if the user is on a bad network? There are a few issues with this scenario. Let's look at them one by one:</p>
<!-- Sync handler with delayed api response -->
<iframe src=\\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/sync-handler-with-delayed-response-6c18h?autoresize=1&#x26;fontsize=14&#x26;hidenavigation=1&#x26;module=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js&#x26;theme=dark\\" style=\\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\\" title=\\"Sync handler with delayed response\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\\" sandbox=\\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\\"></iframe>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now if you click the button, there's no immediate feedback to the user. User may feel like it's not working. Only to eventually find out that the result is loaded after 4s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this 4s time gap, the user may just click the button again thinking it was not clicked the first time 🤦‍♂️. This leads to unnecessary api calls. Also, it may render the results twice, once for each response from the api call. This is based on the implementation but it could lead us to handling more edge cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=\\"writing-components-with-async-event-handler\\"><a href=\\"#writing-components-with-async-event-handler\\">Writing Components With Async Event Handler</a></h2>
<p>Let's look at the same example but this time implemented with async onClick handler.</p>
<iframe src=\\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/async-onclick-handler-1fpb3?autoresize=1&#x26;fontsize=14&#x26;hidenavigation=1&#x26;module=%2Fsrc%2FButton.js&#x26;theme=dark\\" style=\\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\\" title=\\"Async onClick handler\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\\" sandbox=\\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\\"></iframe>
<p>What did we change? We made the <code>onClick</code> function passed to button <code>async function</code> which resolves after the response from the api call. We also added a <code>Button</code> component which has it's own internal state which enables the button or shows the 'loading' state. The <code>Button</code> component can internally change this state based on when it's clicked and when the <code>onClick</code> handler resolves.</p>
<h3 id=\\"benefits-of-using-async-event-handler\\"><a href=\\"#benefits-of-using-async-event-handler\\">Benefits Of Using Async Event Handler</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users get a visual feedback on the action of click.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state of <code>Button</code> component is internally handled by the component. A traditional approach to solve this has been to pass a <code>isDisabled</code> prop to the <code>Button</code> component. But why would we want to add logic to enable/disable button for each button we use in our app when the component itself can take care of it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some apps show a full screen spinner to indicate that they are fetching data from api. It works but again, don't we end up writing the logic to toggle the spinner on button click? Additionally, why hide the existing content until we're fetching new one? Inputs with async handler can manage their state (loaded/loading) internally and have this UX advantage that they don't end up changing any of the existing content on page and still communicate to the user that new data is being fetched. Wouldn't it be nice to have the meaningful content on the page for user's reference than show a spinner? In some cases, may be yes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we considered a button component but, this same logic can be extending to all forms of input components.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a input box with some async validations. How nice it'd be, if the input component can update it's state (show user the validation error) based on whether the async <code>onChange</code> is resolved or rejected. We can even reject it with the custom validation error message for input component to show!</p>

<p>Yes! So the <code>.then</code> / <code>.catch</code> methods are only available on Promises but if you use <code>async</code> / <code>await</code>, you don't have to worry about whether the function is synchronous or returns a Promise.</p>
<pre><code class=\\"hljs language-js\\"><span class=\\"hljs-keyword\\">await</span> syncOnClickHandler(); <span class=\\"hljs-comment\\">// This doesn't throw error! It's safe to use await on anything</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It's important to know that async functions are executed immediately, only the code after the first <code>await</code> goes to microtask queue. So if you plan to use <code>event.preventDefault()</code> or <code>event.stopPropagation()</code>, these calls should be made before using <code>await</code>.</p>
<pre><code class=\\"hljs language-js\\"><span class=\\"hljs-keyword\\">async</span> <span class=\\"hljs-function\\"><span class=\\"hljs-keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"hljs-title\\">onClick</span>(<span class=\\"hljs-params\\">e</span>) </span>{
    e.preventDefault(); <span class=\\"hljs-comment\\">// ✅</span>
    <span class=\\"hljs-keyword\\">await</span> someApiCall();
    e.stopPropagation(); <span class=\\"hljs-comment\\">// this doesn't work because e.stopPropagation has to be called synchronously</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Hope you found it helpful! Let's write more components with async friendly event handler :)</p>",
